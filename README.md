Flutterbot is a new work in progress open source javascript discord bot for fun, games & general purpose. 

This is currently just a fun project for a smaller server. In the future, this project might expand if I can gather the resources needed to create a remote host and maintain upkeep.

to install, make sure you have the latest version of npm installed on the command line. Download from github as an zip archive, and extract it where you'd like your woeking directory to be. cd to the directory that contains "main.js", and run "npm install" to make sure that all of Fluttershy's dependencies are downloaded and installed.
